**The Libft Project (Library Forty Two - Library 42)**

The libft project is a project that aims to introduce 42 students to the basic principles of programming. Throughout the 42 common core curriculum, most projects are programmed in the C language. And libft (library forty two - library 42) is one of these projects.

During libft, students are encouraged to create some functions from the C language standard libraries.

We will create our own library for the C language. This project is an opportunity to delve deeper into the basic and fundamental concepts of the C language.

Concepts such as variables, memory, pointers, memory allocation and even unit tests will be explored.

Now let's get to the Libft project!
